# KDAG-WEB-25AG10049-KrishnaSoni
Hello, my name is Krishna Soni, I am a first year undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, I am from Bangalore, Karnataka.
I had a very keen interest for programming since many years, in class 6th-7th I started learning HTML, CSS so I already had a basic idea of those two languages.
I also build 2 websites in those days, one was using a template and one from just basics, although never hosted them. In class 10th I started learning C++
from a offline mentor for almost 8 months consistently and grasped a decent amount of knowledge in that. Although I never got a chance to use JS, even in my task
it would be cleaarly visible that I have avoided using JS as much as possible but still it was not that tough since I know C++.
I would've made a really better website if I had more time (I've only slept for 5 hours in last two days). Also the background in KDAG website is really amusing (couldn't 
crack how to make it using only JS so far but I surely will). Also the questions which are there in quiz are taken directly from AI and I hope that doesn't mean I've violated rules.
Looking forward to learn more in KDAG IIT KGP!!
Thank You...
